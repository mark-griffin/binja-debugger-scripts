# Binary Ninja Debugger Scripts

Having a scriptable debugger is a really cool thing, and integrating it with
your favorite disassembler/RE tools is even better.

This repo shares some ideas for things to do with
[Binary Ninja's debugger](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger).

Written for Python3 (versions that can support typing). Naturally these scripts
depend on having the debugger module importable.
